Tuenti Contest Solutions
========================

This repo is created with only one proposal: share my solutions to
the #tuentiContest community.

Executing the programs
======================

For execute the problem test you just have to do this::

	python num/program.py < num/test.txt

For example::

	python 7/program.py < 7/test.txt

If the problem you want to solve is the 7th.
