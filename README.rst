Tuenti Contest Solutions
========================

This repo is created with only one proposal: share my solutions to
the #tuentiContest community.

Executing the programs
======================

For execute the problem test you just have to do this::

	python num/program.py < num/test.txt

For example::

	python 7/program.py < 7/test.txt

If the problem you want to solve is the 7th.


Notes
=====
The problems 5, 11 and 16 are solved with Sage_. So, if you want to
execute the tests just do::

	/path/to/sage -python 5/program.py < 5/test.txt
